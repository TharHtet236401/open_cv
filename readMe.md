# Image Processing Examples with Cats and Dogs Dataset

This project demonstrates various image processing techniques using Python, OpenCV, and Matplotlib. The examples use the Cats and Dogs dataset from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The images used in this project are from the ["Cat and Dog"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog) dataset available on Kaggle. Please download the dataset and organize it in the following structure:

## Features

The notebook demonstrates several image processing techniques:

- Loading and displaying images using OpenCV and Matplotlib
- Converting between BGR and RGB color spaces
- Grayscale conversion
- Image resizing
- Image filtering effects:
  - Sharpening using custom kernel
  - Blurring using custom kernel

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
